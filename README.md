# Cull Less Leaves Legacy
This is a backport of isXander's [Cull Less Leaves](https://github.com/isXander/CullLessLeaves) mod to Minecraft 1.12.2, licensed under the LGPL 3.0 license.

## Description
Cull Less Leaves Legacy improves performance by skipping the rendering of inner leaf layers. This can provide a significant performance boost, especially on lower-end hardware, with performance increase in visually dense areas like Twilight Forest(hopefully).
##  Features
* Performance Improvement: Skips rendering inner leaf layers to improve frame rates.
* Configurable: Unlike other leaf-culling mods that only render the outermost layer, Cull Less Leaves Legacy allows you to configure the number of leaf layers to render.
